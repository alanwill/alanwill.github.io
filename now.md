title: What am I doing now?

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now3), here’s what I’m doing at the moment:

* Exercising more. I'm now  more diligent about completing at least 2 of the 3 rings of my [Apple Watch Activity](http://www.apple.com/watch/health-and-fitness/) monitor at least 5 days a week and looking at buying a Concept2 rower to workout at home.
* As part of the above, I'm taking the dogs out on a 1 hour minimum walk every day, weather permitting.
* Just crossed my 10 year anniversary at Autodesk and contemplating what that means for me.
* Teaching myself Python thanks to [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036)
* As a result of my new Python learnings I've been dabbling on a couple mini projects, namely, [urlshortener-tool](https://github.com/alanwill/urlshortener-tool) and [ecobee-tool](https://github.com/alanwill/ecobee-tool)
* About to end my 7 week sabbatical which proved to be the best time ever all spent thinking, creating and doing. Hoping to continue even after I return and not get sucked back into my previous unsustainable ways.
* Looking forward to returning to work with a fresh set of eyes and a new outlook on how to work, better.
* Starting to use [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/alanwill) to "forcibly" keep me on top of my goals, one of them being to write at least 2 blog postings per month.
* Bought a domain, programe.io, as a holding spot for a project idea I'm working on related to Quantified Self
